A typical NetFPGA project is organized as hardware part (hw)
and software part (sw, including embedded software and host
software).

This project requires the following NetFPGA components in the hardware lib:
nf7_1g_interface
nf10_axis_gen_check
nf7_mdio


Make options include:

all: 
Build software-initialized bitfile in bitfiles/download.bit

sim:
Rebuild software and run full system simulation.
ISIM is presently the default simulator.  A licensed version 
of ISIM is recommended to achieve sufficient performance.

download: 
Transfer software-initialized bitfile to PCB 

download_test:
Verify hardware setup using a pre-generated bitstream

run:
This option rebuilds software then downloads the elf to the 
previously configured FPGA using the microblaze debug module.

simclean:
Enable simulation re-generation from scratch.

clean:
Remove all generated files.
