A typical NetFPGA-10G project is organized as hardware part (hw)
and software part (sw, including embedded software and host
software).

To build the project, simply use "make". The resulting bitfile is
under bitfiles/

This project was built using Xilinx tools version 14.6.

Embedded software is not included in this project because there is no software
required at this time.

The host software (driver and application) has been tested on Fedora 19.

To build the driver, enter the sw/host/driver directory and follow the
instructions in the README file.

This project has its own 'lib' folder using symbolic links so that it doesn't
include the Xilinx IP that was created in the default lib folder.
