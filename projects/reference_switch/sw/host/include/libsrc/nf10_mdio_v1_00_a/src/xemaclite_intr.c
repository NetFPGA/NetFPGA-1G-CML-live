* 1.01a ecm  03/31/04 First release
* 1.11a mta  03/21/07 Updated to new coding style
* 2.01a ktn  07/20/09 Modified the XEmacLite_EnableInterrupts and
*                     XEmacLite_DisableInterrupts functions to enable/disable
*                     the interrupt in the Ping buffer as this is used to enable
*                     the interrupts for both Ping and Pong Buffers.
*                     The interrupt enable bit in the Pong buffer is not used by

* 3.00a ktn  10/22/09 Updated file to use the HAL Processor APIs/macros.
*		      The macros have been renamed to remove _m from the name.
