NetFPGA-1G-CML
==============

This release includes the 5.0.5 updates.

This release includes the following changes and additions.

All reference projects in the ./projects directory that do not
specifically target the NetFPGA-1G-CML PCB have been removed. 
This has been done to help reduce any confusion that may exist
regarding which projects to use with which card.

projects/reference_nic_nf1_cml
  This project was modified to support automatic out-of-the-box 
  configuration when it is installed in the on-board BPI during manufacturing.

projects/reference_nic_nf1_cml/sw/host/driver
  The nf10 driver has been updated to support Linux Kernels 3.17.0 and later.

contrib-projects/nf1_cml_io_example
  This project demonstrates the use of the onboard LEDs, buttons, 
  SD card, PMODs and DDR memory using standard ISE/EDK IP modules.

contrib-projects/nf1_cml_crypto_example
  This project demonstrates how to access the on-board ATSHA204
  CryptoAuthentication chip and on-board Real Time Clock. This project
  requires the ability to program the on-board PIC MCU. Please see the
  project README for more details.
