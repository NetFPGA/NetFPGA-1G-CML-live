Version ID
==========

This pcore allows access to read the 32 bit USR_ACCESS register. The 32 bit
register can be used to store any user data desired in 32 bits. Potential uses
include version IDs of a design. For example, store the first 32 bits of a GIT
hash in the register to allow someone to see which commit the bitstream was
built with.

This register is set through bitgen using the "-g USR_ACCESS:xxxxxxxx" option,
where xxxxxxxx is the 32 bit hex value that you wish to set. Because this value
is set through the command line option, it allows a value to easily be
scripted.

NOTE: There is also a 32 bit JTAG register that can also be set at bitgen time.
However, this value can only be read through JTAG. This bitgen option (UserID)
may also provide the same functionality if you do not need to read the value
from the FPGA fabric.
