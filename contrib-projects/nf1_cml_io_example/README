NetFPGA-1G-CML IO Example Design
================================

This design includes demonstrates use of the onboard LEDs, buttons, SD card,
PMODs, and DDR memory. It uses only the IP found in the Xilinx ISE/EDK
distribution and none of the NetFPGA IP. The code executes out of DDR memory.

## Overview

There are essentially two modes of operation for the IO example design: a
button and LED test mode and an SD card test mode.

The LED test mode drives a series of patterns to the Pmod8LD on the JA Pmod
connector. The onboard buttons (BTN0 - BTN3) are used to drive the onboard LEDs
(LD0 - LD3). The Pmod8LD pattern runs continuously while depressing the onboard
buttons causes the corresponding onboard LED to illuminate.

The SD card test mode allows the user to view the contents of a FAT32 formatted
SD card and read and write files to the card.


## Board Setup

Connect the PmodUSBUART to the top row of the JB Pmod connector. The Microblaze
processor provides an interactive text interface that can be viewed using
minicom or another terminal program.

This particular design is best used with a Pmod8LD attached to JA Pmod
connector. GPIO is connected to the signals and the software running on the
Microblaze processor drives out a sequence of LED patterns. A Pmod8LD is not
required to run the IO example design, but it provides a simple way of
visualizing the Pmod signals.

A FAT32 formatted SD card is required for the SD card test example. If an SD
card is not present the application will acknowledge that the SD card is
missing and will return to the LED test mode. The SD card detects the position
of the write protect switch on SD cards, however, write protection is ignored.

## Building and Running

Run the `make` command in this directory to see the make help documentation. To
build everything from scratch, program the FPGA, and download the firmware, run
the `make all` command.
