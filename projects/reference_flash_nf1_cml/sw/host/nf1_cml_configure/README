Since the flash hardware is different on the NetFPGA-CML-1G board, the
options to the tool used to program the BPI-Flash have changed somewhat
from the ones used with the original tool.

The -b switch used to specify the bitstream option has been retained in
this tool and has the same use.

The -f option in the original tool was used to specify which flash
device to load. The NetFPGA-CML-1G has only one large BPI-Flash part.
This tool uses a -a option followed by a address in the BPI-Flash. This
allows a address to be specified that will have the specified bitstream
written above the bitstream that resides at the base address and is 
used to configure the FPGA upon cold start of the board.

The -i option was used in the original tool to specify that after 
writing a bitstream to a device, the FPGA was to be re-configured from
the second flash device. This tool retains the -i option, but in this
usage it causes the FPGA to re-configure starting from the address
specified by the -a option.
