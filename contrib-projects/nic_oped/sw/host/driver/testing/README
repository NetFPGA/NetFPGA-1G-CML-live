This directory contains scripts and code for testing the driver and
related software. The tests are organized according to the particular
FPGA hardware configuration on which they depend. Some tests are meant
for having the NetFPGA-10G installed but not configured, some for no
NetFPGA-10G hardware present at all (or powered off), and some are
totally agnostic to the presence of hardware. The README file within
each directory will tell you what's expected of the hardware for the
tests.

Each test within a particular category for FPGA hardware configuration
may have its own specific requirements for system setup. For instance, a
particular test for the 10G reference NIC may require that the ethernet
ports be looped back in a particular arrangement, while another test for
the same hardware may require a different arrangement. The comments in
each testing script or program will describe their individual
requirements.
