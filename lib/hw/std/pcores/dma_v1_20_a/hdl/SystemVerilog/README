These are SystemVerilog source files that were used to generate the 
dma_engine.edf netlist (250MHz version). They are provided for documentation
purposes only, and changing these files will have no  effect on the pcore, 
unless a new netlist is synthesised. One can do that with any tool that supports 
SystemVerilog. Throughout the code only three features of SystemVerilog are 
used: 'logic' type, 'always_ff' and 'always_comb' constructs.

A mapped verilog file (as generated by synopsis tool) of the dma engine is 
provided under name dma_engine.vm.
