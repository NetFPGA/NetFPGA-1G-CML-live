*
* The Xilinx watchdog timer/timebase component supports the Xilinx watchdog
* timer/timebase hardware. More detailed description of the driver operation
* for each function can be found in the xwdttb.c file.
*
* The Xilinx watchdog timer/timebase driver supports the following features:
*   - Polled mode
*   - enabling and disabling (if allowed by the hardware) the watchdog timer
*   - restarting the watchdog.
*   - reading the timebase.
*
* It is the responsibility of the application to provide an interrupt handler
* for the timebase and the watchdog and connect them to the interrupt
* system if interrupt driven mode is desired.
*
* The watchdog timer/timebase component ALWAYS generates an interrupt output
* when:
*   - the watchdog expires the first time
*   - the timebase rolls over
*
* and ALWAYS generates a reset output when the watchdog timer expires a second
* time. This is not configurable in any way from the software driver's
* perspective.
*
* The Timebase is reset to 0 when the Watchdog Timer is enabled.
*
* If the hardware interrupt signal is not connected, polled mode is the only
* option (using IsWdtExpired) for the watchdog. Reset output will occur for the
* second watchdog timeout regardless. Polled mode for the timebase rollover is
* just reading the contents of the register and seeing if the MSB has
* transitioned from 1 to 0.
*
* The IsWdtExpired function is used for polling the watchdog timer and it is
* also used to check if the watchdog was the cause of the last reset. In this
* situation, call Initialize then call WdtIsExpired. If the result is true
* watchdog timeout caused the last system reset. It is then acceptable to
* further initialize the component which will reset this bit.
*
* This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent. It works with
* physical addresses only.  Any needs for dynamic memory management, threads
* or thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must be
* satisfied by the layer above this driver.

* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00a ecm  08/16/01 First release
* 1.00b jhl  02/21/02 Repartitioned driver for smaller files
* 1.00b rpm  04/26/02 Made LookupConfig public and added XWdtTb_Config
* 1.10b mta  03/23/07 Updated to new coding style
* 1.11a sdm  08/22/08 Removed support for static interrupt handlers from the MDD
*		      file
* 2.00a ktn  22/10/09 The driver is updated to use HAL processor APIs/macros.
*		      The following macros defined in xwdttb_l.h file have been
*		      removed - XWdtTb_mEnableWdt, XWdtTb_mDisbleWdt,
*		      XWdtTb_mRestartWdt, XWdtTb_mGetTimebaseReg and
*		      XWdtTb_mHasReset.
*		      Added the XWdtTb_ReadReg and XWdtTb_WriteReg
*		      macros. User should XWdtTb_ReadReg/XWdtTb_WriteReg to
*		      acheive the desired functioanality of the macros that
*		      were removed.
* </pre>
