A typical NetFPGA-10G project is organized as hardware part (hw)
and software part (sw, including embedded software and host
software).

To build the project, simply use "make". The resulting bitfile is
under bitfiles/ and is suitable for immediately configuring the device
using the Xilinx iMPACT tool. After that you can perform a warm restart of
your system that will allow PCIe to be configured by the host without
losing the FPGA configuration as a cold restart would cause. After the
PCIe has been configured by the host, the driver can be loaded and the
flash programmer application can be used. A bitstream that will be stored
in the BPI-Flash by this project's flash programmer application must be in
the Xilinx *.bin format. An example of how to convert a typical Xilinx
*.bit file into the appropriate *.bin file for the NetFPGA-1G-CML board
uses this project's *.bit file. This example is found in the Makefile in
the hw/ subdirectory using the "bin" target, aong with the create_bin.cmd
for the iMPACT tool.

This project was built using Xilinx tools version 14.6.

Embedded software is not included in this project because there is no software
required at this time.

The host software (driver and nf1_configure) has been tested on Fedora 20.

To build the driver and the applications, enter the sw/host/driver directory
run "make". Then do the same in the sw/host/nf1_configure directory.

This project has its own 'lib' folder using symbolic links so that it doesn't
include the Xilinx IP that was created in the default lib folder.
