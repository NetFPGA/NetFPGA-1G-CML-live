<msg type="warning" file="PhysDesignRules" num="1842" delta="new" >One or more GTXs are being used in this design. Evaluate the SelectIO-To-GTX Crosstalk section of the Virtex-5 RocketIO GTX Transceiver User Guide to ensure that the design SelectIO usage meets the guidelines to minimize the impact on GTX performance.

<msg type="warning" file="PhysDesignRules" num="372" delta="new" >Gated clock. Clock net <arg fmt="%s" index="1">dma_0/dma_0/ep/pcie_ep0/pcie_blk/SIO/.pcie_gt_wrapper_i/icdrreset&lt;0&gt;</arg> is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
