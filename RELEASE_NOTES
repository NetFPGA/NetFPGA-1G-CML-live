GIT VERSION 4.9.0

Before using this code, please check the release notes for 4.9.0 below

1. Reference Router:

A fully functional reference router project along with the SW tools ( /projects/reference_router/sw/host) for its management is included in this release.

Documentation: https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/NetFPGA-10G-Reference-Router

2. PCIE programming:

PCIE programming is incorporated as a default implementation for reference_nic, reference_switch, reference_router and reference_switch_lite projects.Run 'make' generates a bit file enabling PCIE programming in all the projects.

Documentation: https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/PCIE-Programming

3. HW tests.

Python based HW Tests for for reference_nic, reference_switch, reference_switch_lite. Contains the following: 
bashrc (global), Python library (global top level library), Python library (project specific library containing register defines), python parser (to convert xparameters.h to reg_defines.py),
Test folder (project specific contains conn, global and hw tests files), Shared library(global library)

Documentation : https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/HW-Tests

4. Partial synthesis

Partial synthesis is incorporated in the projects of reference_nic, reference_switch, reference_router and reference_switch_lite.This process should be determined by a user depending on the hw implementation.

Documentation: https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/Partial-Synthesis

5. New pcores :

The following pcores have been added
nf10_identifier_v1_00_a -- used to identify (gives the time it was created and the name) the bitfile loaded in the FPGA
nf10_input_arbiter_v1_10_a  -- input arbiter with registers
nf10_10g_interface_v1_20_a -- nf10_10g interface with registers to check only good packets.
nf10_bram_output_queues_v1_01_a -- BRAM ouput queues with fix from Shahbaz
nf10_bram_output_queues_v1_10_a -- BRAM output queues with registers
nf10_router_output_port_lookup_v1_10_a -- router output port look up with registers

6. Driver:
Driver updated to fix multiple threads reading/writing axi registers
